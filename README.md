## Installation
### Non-root users
- Install [ReVanced GmsCore](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases/latest) or [Morphe MicroG-RE](https://github.com/MorpheApp/MicroG-RE/releases/latest).
- Download the APK files you want to install from the [releases page](../../releases/latest).
- (Optional) Import one of my [**Custom Settings**](../teejay/custom_settings-by_tanjid) into your application. [*How to do this?*](../teejay/?tab=readme-ov-file#import-custom-settings-in-revancedmorphe-applications)
- Enjoy!

### Root users
- Download the ZIP files you want to flash from the [releases page](../../releases/latest).
- (Optional) Import one of my [**Custom Settings**](../teejay/custom_settings-by_tanjid) into your application. [*How to do this?*](../teejay/?tab=readme-ov-file#import-custom-settings-in-revancedmorphe-applications)
- (Optional) Use [**zygisk-detach**](https://github.com/j-hc/zygisk-detach) to detach YouTube and YT Music from Play Store if you are using magisk modules.
- Enjoy!

## Import custom settings in ReVanced/Morphe applications
I personally like my YouTube and YouTube Music applications to be as close as possible to the original look, but less cluttered, easier, and less annoying to use. If you feel the same, I highly recommend importing [my custom settings files](../teejay/custom_settings-by_tanjid).

**To do this, go to YouTube Settings &rarr; ReVanced/ReVanced Extended/Morphe &rarr; Miscellaneous &rarr; Import&nbsp;/&nbsp;Export settings.**

## To include/exclude patches or patch other apps

 * Star the repo :eyes:
 * Use the repo as a [template](https://github.com/new?template_name=revanced-magisk-module&template_owner=j-hc)
 * Customize [`config.toml`](./config.toml) using [rvmm-config-gen](https://j-hc.github.io/rvmm-config-gen/)
 * Run the build [workflow](../../actions/workflows/build.yml)
 * Grab your modules and APKs from [releases](../../releases)

also see here [`CONFIG.md`](./CONFIG.md)

## If you are having trouble with the classic mount method of the modules
such as,
- **"Reflash needed"** error after reboots
- **"Suspicious mount detected"** warnings from root detector apps

You can consider using [rvmm-zygisk-mount](https://github.com/j-hc/rvmm-zygisk-mount)
